# Basic Snake
 Basic snake game created in C++ for the console which is based off of NVitanovic's YouTube video with personal modifications and adjustments. 


# How to Play
 Simply run the .cpp file and you will be prompted with an option to start or quit. Movement is handled through WASD and the snake will wrap around the screen rather than simply dieing when hitting a wall. If the game is too fast or too slow, you can adjust the sleep time in main() to a lower or higher amount respectively. Good luck!
